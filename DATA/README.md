Prompt: Given a dataset of customer information, implement an algorithm to predict customer churn. The dataset includes features such as customer demographics, purchase history, and interaction history. The output should be a list of customer IDs predicted to churn, sorted in descending order of likelihood. Handle edge cases where data may be missing or inconsistent. The algorithm should be able to handle large datasets and return results within a reasonable time frame.
