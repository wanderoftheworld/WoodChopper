Prompt: Given a trained machine learning model and a dataset, implement a function that calculates and returns a list of tuples, each containing a feature name and its corresponding importance score. The function should handle both regression and classification models, and should be able to handle models with any number of features. The importance score should be calculated using permutation feature importance. The function should also handle edge cases where the model or dataset is null.
